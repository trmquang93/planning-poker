# Memory Bank Module

This module implements a comprehensive project memory system for maintaining context across development sessions. It can be used independently or integrated with other framework modules. 
**MUST** read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Core Concept

The Memory Bank is a structured documentation system that preserves project knowledge across sessions. It ensures consistent understanding of the project regardless of time between interactions.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format:

```
flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]
```

### Core Files

1. @.memory-bank/projectbrief.md
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Core requirements and project goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. @.memory-bank/productContext.md
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. @.memory-bank/activeContext.md
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations

4. @.memory-bank/systemPatterns.md
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships

5. @.memory-bank/techContext.md
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies

6. @.memory-bank/progress.md
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues

### Additional Context Files
Additional files can be created for specialized documentation:
- Feature specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## Memory Update Protocol

Update the Memory Bank when:
1. Completing significant tasks
2. Discovering new project patterns
3. Explicitly requested with "update memory bank"
4. Context needs clarification

When updating:
1. Review all existing files
2. Document current state
3. Clarify next steps
4. Document insights and patterns

## Core Workflow

1. **Session Start**: Read ALL Memory Bank files
2. **Task Analysis**: Understand requirements in context
3. **Implementation**: Execute work methodically
4. **Documentation**: Update Memory Bank with new knowledge

## Integration with Other Modules

- **Developer Profile**: Use technical skills from Developer module to maintain techContext.md
- **Task Management**: Incorporate task tracking data into progress.md and activeContext.md
- **TDD Methodology**: Document test strategies and coverage in testing-specific files

## Usage Guidelines

### Independent Usage
When used as a standalone module:
- Create and maintain all core Memory Bank files
- Follow the update protocol after significant work
- Document all aspects of the project comprehensively

### Integrated Usage
When combined with other modules:
- Task Management data flows into activeContext.md and progress.md
- TDD metrics and strategies are documented in testing files
- Technical skills from Developer Profile inform techContext.md

## File Content Guidelines
- Keep each file focused on its specific domain
- Update related files together to maintain consistency
- Place information in the most appropriate context file
- Document decisions along with their rationale

This Memory Bank module ensures knowledge persistence and consistent understanding regardless of time between development sessions.
