# Product Context - Planning Poker Application

## Why This Project Exists
Remote agile teams struggle with estimation sessions due to:
- **Sequential inefficiency**: Going around the "virtual room" asking each person takes too long
- **Anchoring bias**: First person's estimate influences everyone else's judgment
- **Meeting disruption**: Traditional polling breaks conversation flow and momentum

## Problems We Solve

### Primary Pain Points
1. **Time Waste**: Traditional remote estimation takes 3-5x longer than in-person
2. **Biased Estimates**: Sequential disclosure creates psychological anchoring effects
3. **Meeting Flow**: Interrupting discussions to poll individuals disrupts team dynamics
4. **Participation**: Quieter team members may not speak up after others share estimates

### User Needs
- **Facilitators** need session control and progress visibility
- **Team Members** need private estimation without bias pressure
- **Teams** need efficient, unbiased estimation process
- **Organizations** need cost-effective tools without vendor lock-in

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals
1. **Frictionless Joining**: No accounts, instant access via links/codes
2. **Intuitive Interface**: No training required, immediate productivity
3. **Real-time Feedback**: Instant updates showing session progress
4. **Mobile-Friendly**: Works seamlessly on all devices
5. **Reliable Performance**: Consistent experience even with poor connections

### Core User Flows

#### Session Creation & Joining
1. Facilitator creates session → gets shareable link + session code
2. Team members join via link or code → enter display name
3. Real-time participant list updates for all users
4. Multiple facilitators can manage same session

#### Estimation Process
1. Facilitator adds story with title and description
2. Team members privately select estimates (hidden from others)
3. Progress indicator shows who has voted (no estimate values)
4. Facilitator reveals all votes simultaneously
5. Discussion happens, re-votes possible
6. Facilitator records final consensus estimate

#### Session Management
1. Stories tracked with status: not estimated, in progress, completed
2. Session summary shows all estimates and final values
3. Export functionality for sharing results
4. Automatic cleanup after session completion

### Expected Outcomes
- **Faster Sessions**: 50% reduction in estimation time
- **Better Estimates**: Elimination of anchoring bias
- **Higher Engagement**: All team members participate equally
- **Improved Decisions**: Focus on discussion rather than polling mechanics

## Success Indicators
- Teams complete estimation sessions without technical issues
- Estimates show natural distribution (not clustered around first votes)
- Users find interface intuitive without documentation
- Sessions remain stable through connection interruptions
- Export functionality provides useful output for sprint planning
