# Planning Poker Web App - Project Brief

## Project Vision
A production-ready, real-time Planning Poker web application designed for remote agile teams to conduct efficient and unbiased estimation sessions.

## Core Problems Solved
1. **Time Inefficiency**: Eliminates sequential polling by enabling simultaneous estimation
2. **Estimation Bias**: Prevents anchoring bias through private voting with simultaneous reveal
3. **Remote Collaboration**: Provides seamless real-time experience for distributed teams

## Success Metrics
- Sub-2-second real-time updates across all connected clients
- Zero estimation bias through private voting mechanism
- 95% uptime on free hosting infrastructure
- Support for concurrent sessions with 2-10 participants each
- Successful session completion rate >98%

## Technical Constraints
- Must deploy on free hosting platforms (Vercel, Railway, Render)
- Real-time functionality via WebSockets required
- No database costs (in-memory/file-based storage)
- Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge last 2 versions)
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices

## Scope Boundaries
- Web application only (no native mobile apps)
- No user authentication or long-term data storage
- No integration with external project management tools
- Self-service user onboarding only
- Minimal customer support infrastructure

## Key Features
1. **Session Management**: Create/join sessions via links or codes
2. **Real-time Voting**: Private estimates with facilitator-controlled reveal
3. **Story Management**: Add stories with descriptions during sessions
4. **Multi-facilitator**: Multiple session managers with equal privileges
5. **Export Results**: CSV and text format export capabilities
6. **Session Persistence**: Survive facilitator disconnections

## Quality Standards
- Test-driven development with comprehensive coverage
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Modern web standards and accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization for minimal resource usage
- Security best practices for session isolation
