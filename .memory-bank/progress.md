## Timeline Estimation

### Phase 1: Foundation (3-4 hours)
- Project setup and configuration
- Development environment establishment
- Basic structure and tooling

### Phase 2: Core Features (8-10 hours)
- Session management implementation
- Real-time communication setup
- Basic voting functionality

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (6-8 hours)
- Complete voting workflow
- Export functionality
- Error handling

### Phase 4: Production Polish (4-6 hours)
- Performance optimization
- Mobile responsiveness
- Deployment setup

**Total Estimated**: 21-28 hours of development

## Blockers and Risks

### Current Blockers
- None (ready to begin implementation)

### Identified Risks
1. **WebSocket Hosting**: Free tier limitations on WebSocket connections
   - **Mitigation**: Multiple platform options, connection pooling
2. **Session Persistence**: Memory limitations on free hosting
   - **Mitigation**: Efficient cleanup, file-based backup
3. **Mobile Performance**: Complex real-time updates on mobile
   - **Mitigation**: Progressive enhancement, optimized updates

### Dependencies
- Node.js 18+ LTS for development environment
- Modern browser for testing
- Free hosting account setup (Vercel, Railway)

## Next Session Planning
**Immediate Focus**: Initialize project structure and development environment
**Success Criteria**: Working development setup with basic React app and Express server
**Time Estimate**: 2-3 hours

**Key Tasks for Next Session**:
1. Create TaskMaster task breakdown for detailed planning
2. Initialize package.json and dependency installation
3. Set up TypeScript configuration
4. Configure Vite build system
5. Establish basic project structure

This foundation will enable efficient TDD implementation of core features in subsequent sessions.
