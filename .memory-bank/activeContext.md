# Active Context - Planning Poker Implementation

## Current Phase
**Phase 1: Project Foundation & Setup**

## Understanding Percentage
**100%** - Ready to begin implementation

## Current Focus
Creating the initial project structure and establishing the development foundation for a state-of-the-art Planning Poker application.

## Immediate Objectives
1. Initialize project with selected technology stack
2. Set up development environment and tooling
3. Create comprehensive task breakdown using TaskMaster
4. Establish testing framework following TDD methodology
5. Begin core session management implementation

## Recent Decisions

### Technology Stack Finalized
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Zustand
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + Socket.IO + In-memory storage
- **Testing**: Vitest + Jest + React Testing Library + Supertest
- **Deployment**: Vercel (frontend) + Railway (backend)

### Architecture Approach
- Real-time WebSocket communication for session synchronization
- Component-based React architecture with custom hooks
- In-memory session storage with JSON file persistence
- Event-driven backend with Socket.IO rooms for session isolation

### Development Methodology
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) with comprehensive coverage
- TaskMaster for complex task management and progress tracking
- Memory Bank for maintaining project context across sessions
- Continuous integration with automated testing and deployment

## Active Considerations

### Implementation Priorities
1. **Core Functionality First**: Session management and real-time voting
2. **Scalability Planning**: Design for future growth within constraints
3. **User Experience Focus**: Intuitive interface requiring no training
4. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize resource usage for free hosting

### Technical Challenges Identified
- WebSocket connection management across different hosting platforms
- Session persistence without database costs
- Real-time synchronization with potential network issues
- Mobile responsiveness for voting interface

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- Multiple deployment platform options (Vercel, Railway, Render)
- Graceful degradation for connection issues
- Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- Automated testing to prevent regressions

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed task breakdown with TaskMaster
2. Initialize project structure with package.json and configuration
3. Set up development environment with linting and testing
4. Implement core session management following TDD
5. Build real-time communication layer with Socket.IO

## Key Milestones Ahead
- [ ] Project foundation complete (development setup, basic structure)
- [ ] Core session management (create, join, manage participants)
- [ ] Real-time voting system (private votes, reveal mechanism)
- [ ] Story management (add, track, estimate stories)
- [ ] Export functionality (CSV, text formats)
- [ ] Production deployment (hosting setup, monitoring)

## Context for Future Sessions
This is a production-ready implementation focusing on:
- Real-time collaboration for remote agile teams
- Unbiased estimation through private voting
- Free hosting compatibility with professional features
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance

The application solves core problems of remote estimation bias and time inefficiency while maintaining professional-grade reliability and user experience.
