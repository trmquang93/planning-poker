# Planning Poker Web App - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

### Project Vision
A web-based Planning Poker application designed specifically for remote agile teams to conduct efficient and unbiased estimation sessions. The app eliminates the two primary pain points of remote estimation: time inefficiency from sequential polling and estimation bias from premature disclosure of individual estimates.

### Problem Statement
Remote agile teams face significant challenges during estimation sessions:
- **Time Inefficiency**: Asking each team member individually for estimates is time-consuming and disrupts meeting flow
- **Estimation Bias**: When one person shares their estimate first, it influences others' judgments, leading to anchoring bias and less accurate estimates

### Solution Overview
A real-time web application that facilitates simultaneous estimation reveal, ensuring all team members provide unbiased estimates while streamlining the estimation process for distributed teams.

### Success Metrics
- Reduced estimation session duration compared to traditional remote methods
- Elimination of sequential estimation bias
- High user adoption among small agile teams (2-10 members)
- Successful session completion rate with minimal technical issues

## User Stories & Personas

### Primary Personas

**1. Session Facilitator (Scrum Master/Product Owner)**
- Creates and manages estimation sessions
- Controls session flow and timing
- Adds stories to be estimated
- Manages team participation and final estimate decisions

**2. Team Member (Developer/Tester/Analyst)**
- Joins estimation sessions via invitation
- Provides private estimates for work items
- Participates in estimation discussions
- Views estimation results and session progress

### User Stories

#### Session Management
- **As a facilitator**, I want to create a new estimation session so that my team can estimate our sprint backlog
- **As a facilitator**, I want to invite team members via shareable link or session code so they can join the session easily
- **As a facilitator**, I want multiple facilitators to manage the same session so that Product Owners and Scrum Masters can collaborate
- **As a team member**, I want to join a session using either an invite link or session code so I have flexible access options

#### Story Management
- **As a facilitator**, I want to add stories with titles and optional descriptions so the team understands what they're estimating
- **As a facilitator**, I want to see which stories are not estimated, currently being estimated, and completed so I can track session progress
- **As a team member**, I want to see the current story details so I understand what I'm estimating

#### Estimation Process
- **As a team member**, I want to select my estimate privately so others cannot see my choice until everyone has voted
- **As a facilitator**, I want to see who has voted and who is still pending so I can manage the session timing
- **As a facilitator**, I want to manually reveal votes when ready so I control the session flow
- **As a facilitator**, I want to trigger re-votes when needed so the team can reach better consensus
- **As all users**, I want to see all estimates with participant names after reveal so we can discuss discrepancies

#### Results Management
- **As a facilitator**, I want the system to suggest final estimates based on team votes so I have a starting point for consensus
- **As a facilitator**, I want to override suggested estimates when the team agrees on a different value
- **As a facilitator**, I want to export session results in CSV or text format so I can share outcomes with stakeholders
- **As all users**, I want to see a session summary at the end so we can review all estimation decisions
